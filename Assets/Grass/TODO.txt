ToDo For Grass:
[X] Normalize image sampling index (0-1) to get same sampling scale in any texture
	[X] Allows to use smaller placement map textures for similar effect
[ ] LOD grass doesnt always match color, add white and black overlay/multiplication parameter
[ ] Grass mesh has 2 extra vertecies after importing from Blender
[ ] Use card mesh (1 sided quad with texture) for LOD grass
	[ ] Since it takes up more space less positions points should be used
	[ ] Smaller density for far grass
	[ ] Grass could rotate towards player
	[ ] Blend card mesh and grass blade mesh when switching LOD to avoid pop-in
		[ ] When switching from low LOD to high quality grass try to make the grass grow from the ground to avoid pop-in
	[X] Use alpha cutout to avoid overdraw
[X] Calculate how many grass positions exist inside of every chunk to lower Compute Buffer size
[ ] Instead of using a culling buffer try using the boolean value within Grass struct to check if grass should be culled or not
[ ] Bend the grass mesh at center for a more realistic effect
[ ] Rotate the blades towards camera to avoid thin looking grass
[ ] Possibly add some translucency to the top of the grass blade
[ ] Short grass should use a 1 tri grass mesh
[ ] Dynamic LOD density, grass becomes more dense when walking up close and less in further scenes
	[ ] BOTW creates 2 tips from a blade to imitate a denser feel to the grass
		[ ] Adds extra vertex

[ ] Try animating wind only at the stems of the blade instead of all vertecies
[ ] Think about composition of the grass to use less grass

[ ] IMPORTANT: For some reason some grass that is close to the player in BOTW disappears when approaching it
[ ] IMPORTANT: One blade of grass is procedurally shaped into different types of grass


1. Cull compute buffer size to contain exactly the amount of grass needed
2. During LOD set placePosition bool to false to render less grass
3. During normal grass set placePosition bool to true to render all of the grass
